GA Capstone - Pedestrian movement in Melbourne CBD

Melbourne has been experiencing a rapid increase in population in recent years. The population currently sitting at 5 million in this city, the data reveals an increase of 150,000 each year for the past 5 years and this trend will likely continue. The city will need to adapt to accommodate such trend by appropriate urban planning and management.

One of the most important aspect when we make decisions in city planning is to understand the impact on people. By learning and predicting how pedestrians move within Melbourne CBD, we are able to estimate the way urban planning activities affect Melbournians.
